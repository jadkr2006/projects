Keylog is a Python cybersecurity project that includes a custom keylogger (keylog.py) and a modular keylogger detection system (detector.py). The detector analyzes system behavior through dedicated check modules inside the checks/ directory, including process monitoring, startup persistence inspection, file activity analysis, and USB checks. The project demonstrates both how keyloggers function and how defensive detection mechanisms can be structured in a modular security tool.
